/**
 * @title SimpleCrowdsale
 * @dev This is an example of a fully fledged crowdsale.
 * The way to add new features to a base crowdsale is by multiple inheritance.
 * In order to switch between multistage and single stage, one must also change base contract import of the add-ons.
 * In this example we are providing following extensions:
 * TokenCappedCrowdsale - sets a max boundary for Token sold in milestones
 * RefundableCrowdsale - set a min goal to be reached and returns funds if it's not met
 *
 * After adding multiple features it's good practice to run integration tests
 * to ensure that subcontracts works together as intended.
